# JAX-tutorials
A collection of beginner-friendly JAX notebooks for ML &amp; performance tuning.


This tutorial is for anyone who wants to learn about JAX and its use cases. You will see how it is performance effecient in deep learning tasks compared to other modules like numpy.

I have included code snippets for each concept in this #1 part of JAX series. We will delve deeper into building neural networks with JAX in further parts.

Your reviews and feedback is highly appreciated!ðŸ™ŒðŸ™Œ
